# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

<br/>

<h3> Iâ€™m a third-year <Utils fontSize={'1.2rem'}>Computer Science Engineering</Utils> Major at the  <Utils fontSize={'1.2rem'}>University of Florida</Utils>, and Part-time Software Development Intern at <Utils fontSize={'1.2rem'} href={'https://www.linkedin.com/company/emerging-tech/mycompany/'}>Emerging Tech LLC</Utils>.  My work responsibilities include Spearheading Internal Tool Development, as well as developing and maintaining the <Utils fontSize={'1.2rem'} href={'https://emergingtech.co/'}>company website.</Utils></h3>

<br/>

<div>Although the Computer Science coursework I take is generally language agnostic (DSA, Comp Org, Operating and DB Systems), Iâ€™m passionate about <Utils>Full-stack Web Development</Utils> and <Utils>Data Science</Utils>. Tools I typically use for front-end web development include <Utils>React</Utils>, <Utils>Modular CSS</Utils>, and/or <Utils>TailwindCSS</Utils>. For backend I like building with <Utils>NextJS</Utils>, <Utils>ExpressJS</Utils>, and the Node HTTP library. Iâ€™m interested in learning backend development with C#, as well as mobile development with React Native. I also have a lot of experience with C++ (I do most of my leetcode in C++) and Python (for Machine Learning).</div>

<br/>

<div>Fun Fact: before I was a Computer Science Major, I was an <Utils>Aerospace Engineering major!</Utils> Even after I switched, I continued taking Aerospace Engineering classes for the fun of it. Some of the courses I have under my belt include Dynamics, Intro to Aerospace Engineering, Statics, Mechanics of Materials, and Design and Manufacturing Lab. I love both fields, so I always try to involve myself when opportunities that intersect both arise. In fact, Iâ€™m joining Dr. Christopher Petersonâ€™s UF undergraduate research group in an effort to create an Interactive Interface for Space Simulation using <Utils>OpenMCT</Utils> and <Utils>STK.</Utils></div>

<br/>

When Iâ€™m not programming, I like to play video games. Iâ€™m a Gold 1 warrior on a quest to become Iron 1 ðŸ’ª. I try to stream every now-and-then on Twitch when Iâ€™m playing Valorant. Iâ€™m also a pretty good racquetball player, which is like squash if it was a good sport.

If you got this far, thank you so much for reading! If it interests you, my resume can be found *here* and my socials can be found on the footer of this site. Until next time ðŸ«¡.
