## Some Updatesüòé

I am very happy to be back to writing on this blog after such a long time ü•≥! I was very busy for a good chunk of the past few weeks juggling class, work, research, and internship applications.

<div> What's crazier, I was lucky enough to be granted the opportunity to interview at one of my Dream Companies, <Utils href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana Labs</Utils> for a <b>Growth Engineering Intern (Infrastructure Observability Team)</b> role over the Summer üò≠üíñ! Words can't express how happy and grateful I am to <b>Iulia, Michael, Coleman, and Brad</b> for all the help during the interview process! Super excited to full-dive into the world of Infrastructure Observability üòé</div>
<br/>
<div> In this post, I wanted to recount and reflect a little on my experience with the application and interview process, touch a little bit on my general problem-solving process during the technical portion, and discuss what I'm thinking of doing to prepare for the internship. If you're only interested in the problem-solving part, feel free to skip to the <b>Technical Assessment</b> section</div>
<br/>

## Before I Applied

I've had an eye out for Grafana Labs for some time. I had known about the company since Mid-2021, as it was around that time that I started REAAALLY keeping up with popular/up-and-coming open-source technologies on a day-to-day basis. It wasn't until mid-2022, however, that I really started looking at Grafana (dashboard). I thought the product was super cool, and even watched some YouTube videos about things people have made with it.

It also just so happens that around this time we were starting a new development project at Emerging Tech (ET). One of the things we needed to do was create a dashboard to view, interact with, and interpret aggregate historical government contract data. I pitched to my managers the idea of using Grafana for an in-house tool we were working on, but they wanted to incorporate as few large-scale OSS technologies as possible to avoid licensing issues in the future.

Even though my proposal didn't make it through, I was still interested in the tool as well as Grafana Labs as a company. I went ahead and checked in the Fall to see if I could find any internship positions, but wasn't able to find any ü•≤. I wanted to make something cool at home using Grafana, but I was super busy with work, school, personal projects, and hackathons already, so I put it all on the back burner for the Fall semester.

## Around Early January

<div>Come early January, I had just finished revamping my portfolio site, and was ready to start applying for some Summer internships. As I'm browsing jobs on LinkedIn, I come across a <b>Growth Engineering Intern</b> listing from Grafana! I was like "noooo wayyyy". I remember one of my first thoughts being "how didn't I see this before?!". Needless to say, I applied but didn't expect to hear back at all.</div>
<br/>
<div>That's a large part of the reason why it took me by surprise when I received an email from <b>Isabella</b> from the Grafana Labs Recruiting team üò±üò±! She helped me set up a meeting with Andy Murray from the Grafana Talent Acquisition team. On the day of the interview, I realized that who I was actually going to meet was <b>Iulia Nicolae</b> from the same team ü•≥ü•≥. Probably one of the nicest people I've ever met! We spoke about work at Grafana Labs, how their employees work from across the world, and the different technical teams that I could meet with and work under.</div>
<br/>
<div>I also talked about my experience at ET, why I chose the degree path I chose, and the things I am passionate about. I heard back a few days later and found out that I made it into round 2 ü•≥! For this interview, I had the CRAZY opportunity to speak with <b>Brad Rittenhouse</b>. He's a Senior Engineering Manager at Grafana. We spoke about the Infrastructure Observability team and what their responsibilities are, and he touched on the technology stacks used not just in his team, but around the entire company. I also learned about his work at Elastic prior to joining Grafana Labs, and his experience in moving from working at Elastic to working at Grafana. </div>
<br/>
<div>One thing that I thought was really cool about our conversation was his perspective on employee culture at Grafana. He explained how most engineers share this <b>"personal ownership mindset"</b>, where each engineer embraces the ownership and responsibility they have over their work, and they expect the same from their peers. It's through this mutual respect of autonomy that a network of trust is established throughout the company, making teams act more like a unit, while still benefitting from the diversity of backgrounds and experiences of individual team members. I think that this aligns really well with Grafana Labs's cultural value of <Utils href="https://grafana.com/blog/2020/12/09/the-7-cultural-values-that-drive-grafana-labs/#2-respectfully-empowered">"Respectful Empowerment"</Utils>, and looking back at the conversation we had, this mentality is exactly what I'd be looking for in my future workplace. I had a great time talking with Brad, and I really appreciate all the support I've received from him throughout the interview process!</div>

Eventually, I heard back again and realized that I made it to the technical interviewwww woooooooooo ü•≥!! This was a take-home assessment in the language of my choice (I chose JavaScript). They recommended I spend a maximum of 3 hours working on it, and that I submit whatever I have even if I don't finish.

## The Technical Assessment üòé
I won't be using the actual code from the Grafana challenge for confidentiality reasons, but I did create an example problem that I think is similar in terms of the skills needed. It is also similar (although not exactly) to some of the stuff my coworkers and I have done at Emerging Tech üòÅ.

<h3>The Example Problem</h3>
<br/>
<div>You are a new Frontend Developer at Emerging Tech LLC. you are tasked with working on the Search Feature of an app that allows users to search through government contracts. The way it works is that a user types in a search query, that is passed into a GET request to an external API. The API responds with a JSON object containing an array of <b>Contract Objects</b>, which always have the structure shown in the below diagram</div>
<br/>
<img width="100%" src="https://i.imgur.com/jD0mOmv.png"/>

### The Function
You are tasked with creating a function, `formatContractsList` that takes in the array of **contract objects** as input. This function then returns a **formatted** array of contract objects.

Some of the characteristics of the input data:
* Input data is a list of contract objects as shown above
* Input data is sorted in ascending order by solicitationId, which is always a string literal of integers
* title and description fields can either be a string or `null`
* solicitationId will always be in ascending order, but the interval may not be consistent (e.g., you might have contracts with solicitationId's like `[1, 3, 8]` all in a row);
* setaside will always be a string, but may not necessarily be in "Acronym" format. For instance, the value in the setaside field might say "Small Business" which refers to "SBA"
* Input array length is n where  `0 <= n < 1000`

Some of the characteristics of the expected output:
* Output data has Objects for ALL solicitationId's between the lowest and highest solicitionId's in the input list
* E.G. if we have an input list with solicitationId's [1, 3, 5], we expect an output list with objects with solicitationId [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
* Contract objects added to conform with the output format should have `"N/A"` for their title, description, and setaside fields.
* Duplicates of a solicitationId are removed, with the first occurrence taking priority over others.
* Null values for the "title" and "description" fields should be replaced with "N/A"
* Setaside value should be turned into its acronym form, if not in said form already. Below, you will be able to find what each acronym maps to. If the setaside value does not match any of these attributes, the setaside value of the outputted contract object should be "N/A"

Below is an example input, and the expected output

<img width="100%" src="https://i.imgur.com/bhTMG7F.png"/>

### Step 1 - Evaluating Requirements

The first thing I try to do with assessments of this style is read the prompt more than once. In the first read I usually just try to gain a general understanding of what my code needs to do. On my second read, I try to look at how input requirements map to output requirements, and what operations might be needed to fulfill these requirements. In my experience, the best way of doing this is by looking at the example cases.

For instance, I numbered some of the key transformations in the example case I displayed above.
1. The "Expanded" setaside values from the input array are mapped to their acronyms. There is a finite amount of acronyms and they share a "1-to-1" relationship with their "Expanded" counterparts. A Map data structure may help in this case.
2. Any `null` values are changed into a string containing "N/A". This can be done pretty easily by looping over the keys in each contract object and replacing every occurrence of `null`.
3. Missing solicitationId's are filled in with "empty" contract objects. We know that our output array must have integer solicitationId's in the interval [first_element.solicitationId, last_element.solicitationId], so we could just find this interval, and use a for loop over it ü§î

One important thing to note is that example cases don't always cover all key operations. The example case I provided doesn't deal with duplicate solicitationId's. It also doesn't cover the case where the "setaside" value does not match an acronym/expanded acronym.
### Step 1.5 - Comment EVERYWHERE

Make comments for yourself as you write your solution! It helps you validate that the code you are writing makes sense, and allows for self-reinforcement of useful ideas that may level up your understanding of the problem, or the efficiency of your solution. IMO it's also very important to remove extraneous comments and be as concise as possible, especially when you're making comments for other people to see (something which I did not do in my code for the assessment üò≠üò≠).

### Step 2 - Solve first, Solve Nicely later

This is more of a personal preference but I've found it's helped me and my friends a lot. Sometimes we focus so much on finding the best solution on the first try, that we end up not having enough time to finish writing our code at all. I've found that it's sometimes better to write an OK solution than no solution at all, and often times this "bad solution" leads us to a great solution.

This tactic helped me a lot with the Grafana challenge. Rubber Ducky-ing in the comments of my code helped me build an "OK" solution really fast, which I then evaluate for points of improvement to make an even better solution.

For example, see the code for `formatContractsList` below.

```js
const setasideMap = new Map(Object.entries({
  "Total Small Business Set-Aside": "SBA",
  "Partial Small Business Set-Aside": "SBP",
  "8(a) Set-Aside": "8A",
  "Historically Underutilized Business Sole Source": "HZS",
  "Woman Owned Small Business Set-Aside": "WOSB",
  "Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside": "VSA",
  "SBA": "SBA",
  "SBP": "SBP",
  "8A": "8A",
  "HZS": "HZS",
  "WOSB": "WOSB",
  "VSA": "VSA",
}));
const formatIndividualContract = (contract) => {
  // Turn all instances of `null` to "N/A"
  // Formalize setaside field values
  // account for null values
  Object.keys(contract).forEach((key) => {
    if (contract[key] === null) {
      contract[key] = "N/A";
    }
  });
  // Account for setaside values
  // Take our input's setaside value, map it to a formal value
  let mappedSetaside = setasideMap.get(contract.setaside);
  // If `mappedSetaside` is undefined, we return "N/A"
  // otherwise mappedSetaside contains the formal value
  contract.setaside = mappedSetaside !== undefined ? mappedSetaside : "N/A";

  // Return the contract
  return contract;
};
const formatContractsList = (input) => {
  // I'll Generally split operations between two groups
  // Array-formatting operations -> affect what contracts are in the
  // final array
  // Contract-formatting -> affect what field values are in valid
  // contracts
  // Array-formatting is handled within scope of this function
  // Contract-formatting is handled within "formatIndividualContract"
  let solIdStart = parseInt(input[0].solicitationId);
  let solIdEnd = parseInt(input[input.length - 1].solicitationId);
  let output = []; // Our output array
  for (let i = solIdStart; i < solIdEnd + 1; i++) {
    // Find the fist ocurrence of contract with matching solicitationId
    let currInputContract = input.find(
      (contract) => parseInt(contract.solicitationId) == i
    );
    // The above line returns undefined if the contract
    // with solicitationId == i is not found
    if (currInputContract === undefined) {
      output.push({
        title: "N/A",
        description: "N/A",
        solicitationId: `${i}`,
        setaside: "N/A"
      });
    } else {
      // If our contract was found, format it and push it
      output.push(formatIndividualContract(currInputContract));
    }
  }
  return output;
};
```

At a glance, `formatContractsList`
1. Loops throughout the output array
2. Adds missing solicitationId's as needed
3. Pushes "formatted" versions of the FIRST occurrence (Array.prototype.find() gets the first element matching the condition) of contract objects already present in the input array

I tested this out for just a few inputs üòÇ, but theoretically this should pass most if not all test cases! However, we could definitely make some improvements.

### Step 3 - Spot Points of improvement
At this point, I try to build a great solution out of my first solution. I usually re-read the code I wrote, to find elements I can improve on. Some potential points of improvement can be found below.

1. Our spatial complexity is somewhere around `O(m + n)` where `m` is the length of our output array. We could reduce this to `O(o)`, where `o` is the difference between the first and last solicitationId, by having our array operations be in place, on the input array whenever possible
2. Our computational complexity is something around `O(m*n)`, as we are looping over the output length, and also internally looping over the input array (assuming that `Array.prototype.find()` is `O(n)` at worst)
3. Although I'm using a Map here, I probably would've used an object/dictionary in a real technical interview. Switching to maps gives slight performance boosts dependent on the browser/runtime you are using (performance differences are most apparent when deleting keys on Chrome ü§î).

<div>See <Utils href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/37994079/17785782">This Stack Overflow Answer</Utils> for an excellent performance comparison between Maps and Objects.</div>
<br/>
<div>Also see <Utils href="https://www.youtube.com/@Steve8708">Steve from Builder IO's</Utils> video on Map optimization for deleting keys (this guy has several other awesome videos, make sure to check out his channel!)</div>

<iframe width="100%" height="444" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hubQQ3F337A" title="Use Maps more and Objects less" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Step 4 - Apply Improvements üòé
All we have left to do at this point is improve wherever possible. I'll tackle them point-by-point and explain each

Spatial and Computational complexity can be reduced by having all array-wise and formatting operations be done on the input array. We can sort of "look ahead" and predict what operation we need based on a set of rules. We can do this by taking advantage of the ascending order of solicitationId's
* Loop over the length of the array, not the solicitationId's.
* Keep track of a "currId", which starts at the solicitationId of the first contract in the list.
* Increment our currId whenever we encounter a valid contract in each iteration of the array, or whenever we add a missing contract to the array
* In the case that our currId is larger than the solicitationId of the current contract, we've encountered a duplicate we must delete
* In the case that our currId is smaller than the solicittionId of the current contract, we need to add "empty contracts" to satisfy the interval
* We loop over the array until we reach the last element, and reformat the last element if needed.

Below is a function, `formatContractList2`, which we can create based on the points above.
```js
const formatContractsList2 = (input) => {
  let length = input.length;
  let currId = length > 0 ? parseInt(input[0].solicitationId) : null;
  for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    let contract = input[i];
    if (currId == parseInt(contract.solicitationId)) {
      // our currId is found in the input array
      // we make sure its formatted, and increment our
      // currId;
      input[i] = formatIndividualContract(contract);
      currId++;
    } else if (currId < parseInt(contract.solicitationId)) {
      // Our currId was not found in the input array,
      // we insert an "empty" contract, and update our length
      length++;
      input.splice(i, 0, {
        title: "N/A",
        description: "N/A",
        solicitationId: `${currId}`,
        setaside: "N/A"
      });
      currId++;
    } else if (currId > parseInt(contract.solicitationId)) {
      // the only situation where currId > solicitationId,
      // is when we've encountered a duplicate!
      // In this case, we just splice the duplicate
      // and update the length and index
      length--;
      input.splice(i, 1);
      i--;
    }
  }
  return input;
};
```
<h4>We can see that: </h4>
<ul>
  <li><div>All operations are done <Utils>in-place</Utils></div></li>
  <li><div>We have a single loop, that will run <Utils>"o"</Utils> times, where "o" is the difference between the solicitationId's of the first and last elements.</div></li>
</ul>

And that's it! In the actual challenge, I had a solution with space and time complexity similar to the solution for this example problem. I was pretty happy about it, so I went ahead and submitted it!

I think I heard back from Amanda a few days after I submitted my code, and I was super happy to hear that I made it to the final part of the interview process ü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Ø. This time, I was set to meet with Coleman Rollins and Michael Mandrus, both Software Engineers working in the backend team ü•≥.

## The Final Interview

For this final interview, I met with Michael and Cole. I had a lot of fun speaking with them, and enjoyed learning about their work in Grafana! 

After talking for a bit, they asked me to explain my general thought process for solving the problem. This caught me by surprise, as I was fully expecting another technical assessment. I think I was even working on some work stuff for Emerging Tech beforehand to get in the groove lol. 

They asked me questions about why I made the choices I made, what my thoughts were going into the problem, what issues I encountered, and what improvements I would make looking back at my solution. 

I couldn't help but find it funny when they asked me the last question, because for the whole week leading up to the interview, I was being driven crazy by a mistake I made in my code that would theoretically cause it to fail an edge-case üò≠üò≠.

I really appreciate them taking the time to interview me. I especially appreciate their help with some of my questions about Grafana (dashboard), which helped me decide whether to use it for the research on Satellite Command and Control interfaces I'm doing under Dr. Chrispy.

## The Decision

When I tell you I was anxiously waiting I mean I was ANXIOUSLY waiting. Grafana Labs was literally at the top of my list of companies to work for, **period**. 

At some point the week after my interview, I wanted to ask Iulia if I could make a journal-style blog post about the interview process (which you are reading right now) and very discretely slipped in the question that had been driving me crazy all week "Did you speak with the team yet üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è?" üòÇ.

To my surprise she replied less than an hour later, saying that she DID speak with the team and that I PASSED üò≠üò≠üò≠‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è

<p>My honest reaction upon hearing the news (loud)</p>
</div>

<p>And here I am now writing this blog post! The entire interview process was awesome, and words can't express how grateful and happy I am to be able to make an impact at a company with such awesome products! This semester I'm trying to build my understanding and skills with the tech stack used in the team I'll be joining, which includes <Utils href="https://kubernetes.io/">K8's</Utils>, <Utils href="https://www.docker.com/">Containers + Docker Compose</Utils>, and <Utils href="https://go.dev/">Go</Utils>. Can't wait to start officially on June 5th! ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©</p>
## What I'm BUMPIN Today
This section will be a list today since it has been a while since my last post üòà.
