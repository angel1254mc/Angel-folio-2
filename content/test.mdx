## Some Updatesüòé

I am very happy to be back to writing on this blog after such a long time ü•≥! I was very busy for a good chunk of the past few weeks juggling class, work, research, and internship applications.

<div> What's crazier, I was lucky to enough to be granted the opportunity to interview at one of my Dream Companies, <Utils>Grafana</Utils> for a <b>Growth Engineering Intern (Infrastructure Observability Stream)</b> role over the Summer üò≠üíñ! Words can't express how happy and grateful I am to Iulia, Michael, Coleman, and Brad for all the help during the interview process! Super excited to full-dive into the world of Infrastructure Observability üòé</div>
<br/>
<div> In this post I wanted to recount and reflect a little on my experience with the application and interview process, touch a little bit on my general problem-solving process during the technical portion, and discuss what I'm thinking of doing to prepare for the internship. If you're only interested in the problem-solving part, feel free to skip to the <b>Getting Technical</b> section</div>

## Before I Applied

I've had an eye out for Grafana Labs for some time. I had known about the company since Mid-2021, as it was around that time that I started REAAALLY keeping up with popular/up-and-coming open-source technologies on a day-to-day basis. It wasn't until mid-2022, however, that I really started looking at Grafana (dashboard). I thought the product wasYouTube videos about things people have made using Grafana.

It also just so happens that around this time we were starting a new development project at Emerging Tech (ET). One of the things we needed to do was create a dashboard to view, interact with, and interpret aggregate historical government contract data. I pitched to my managers the idea of using Grafana for an in-house tool we were working on, but they wanted to incorporate as little large-scale OSS technologies as possible to avoid licensing issues in the future.

Even though my proposal didn't make it through, I was still interested in the tool as well as Grafana Labs as a company. I went ahead and checked in the Fall to see if I could find any internship positions, but wasn't able to find any ü•≤. I wanted to make something cool at home using Grafana, but I was super busy with work, school, personal projects, and hackathons already, so I put it all on the backburner for the Fall semester.

## Around Early January

Come early January, I had just finished revamping my portfolio site, and was ready to start applying for some Summer internships. As I'm browsing LinkedIn Jobs, I come across a Growth Engineering Intern listing from Grafana! I was like "noooo wayyyy". I remember one of my first thoughts being "how didn't I see this before?!". Needless to say, I applied but didn't expect to hear back at all.

That's a large part of the reason why it took me by surprise when I received an email from Isabella from the Grafana Labs Recruiting team üò±üò±! She helped me set up a meeting with Andy Murray from the Grafana Talent Acquisition team. On the day of the interview, I realized that who I was actually going to meet was Iulia Nicolae from the same team ü•≥ü•≥. Probably one of the nicest people I've ever met! We spoke about work at Grafana Labs, how their employees work from across the world, and the different technical teams that I could meet with and intern under.

I also talked about my experience at ET, why I chose the degree path I chose, and the things I am passionate about.
