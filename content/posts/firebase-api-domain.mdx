excerpt: Using Google Cloud's API Key Credentials to Secure a Firebase Web Project 
---
#### Happy New Years! ðŸ¥³
<br/>
<div>Over the last few days, I've been researching how to improve the Firebase Security Schema for one of the projects I've been developing for work. and I came across a pretty cool discovery when it comes to security- You can use the Google Cloud platform's API Credentials feature to <Utils>restrict from WHERE your API can be used</Utils> How is this useful? Let's check it out.</div>

<br/>

<div>Say that you're building the newest BlockBuster Typesafe Web3 SaaS (that runs on the blockchain of course) that allows administrators to manage the tasks of a group of users. These administrators have the ability to read and write over any users they manage. They also have the ability to create tasks and assign them to users, as well as delete them. On the other hand, users can only read and write to themselves, and they can view their own tasks. However, the only part of the task that they can modify is the <Utils>"done"</Utils> field of a task, which is a boolean with a value of either true or false.</div>

<br/>

<div>Another useful piece of information is that users and tasks follow a one-to-many relationship. This means that one user can have many tasks, but no one task object can be assigned to more than one user. Let's model this by using a firebase subcollection <Utils>"Tasks"</Utils> located inside of the each user document. This subcollection holds a list of <Utils>Task</Utils> documents. A simple security rule configuration for this might look something like this.</div>
<br/>
```jsx
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    match /user/{userID} {
        // Allow read and write to basic user properties if
        // 1. Request is sent by the user being edited
        // 2. Request comes from an admin
      allow read, write: if (
                        request.auth.uid == userID 
                        || isAdmin(request.auth.uid));

        // Tasks Subcollection stored inside of the users object
        match /tasks/{task} {
          allow read: if (
                        request.auth.uid == userID
                        || isAdmin(request.auth.uid));
          allow update: if (
                        isAdmin(request.auth.uid) ||
                        (request.auth.uid == userID 
                        && request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasOnly(['done']));
          )
          allow create: if isAdmin(request.auth.uid)
          allow delete: if isAdmin(request.auth.uid)
        }
    }
  }
}
```
<br/>

This all seems nice and dandy. Now, hostile actors can't modify or read data they shouldn't have access to. We could add some more things like checking that our `request.resource.data` is in the correct format, but for the purpose of this post let's assume that this is not an issue pulling/pushing. So we're all good right? Our security rules are set and our authentication is good enough to prevent most bots.

## Consider The Following:
<br/>

<div style={{width: '100%', display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>

</div>

You wake up one day and you notice that you are getting 10 times more read requests than usual! Even crazier, they're from a single authorized user- so it doesn't seem to be a security rule problem. You thought that you implemented some semblance of frontend rate-limiting, so you're confused as to how they managed to pull this off. As it turns out, your user copied over the firebaseConfig over to their own app and started doing some shady reads and writes ðŸ¤”. 

We know that, when using Firebase, we expose our API keys to the client- the untrusted environment. It's because of this that we setup security rules to prevent users from accesing things they shouldn't be able to. But what about when the user gets access to a resource they're allowed to read, but not the way you intended?

<div>For instance, lets say that in our awesome Web3 Blockchain-based SaaS WebApp for assigning Tasks, we only allow the user to see 5 tasks on their home page at any given time, and users have the option to paginate through them when the amount of tasks exceeds 5. Our bad actor, who wants all tasks loaded NOW, copies our firebaseConfig and creates a React WebApp that queries for the entire <Utils>Tasks</Utils> subcollection for his user (Which for some reason has an ungodly amount of tasks) and loops over each one of them. Worst part? He's been debugging a 'Too many re-renders' error for the past 2 hours, and that "Task Scraping Function" was running on a dependency-less useEffect ðŸ¥²</div>
<br/>

## GCP API Settings to the Rescue
<br/>
<div>Since Firebase is part of the Google Cloud Platform, our Firebase project is also a GCP project- meaning that we have access to a multitude of tools not shown on the Firebase Console. Google has one particular tool under their **APIs & Services** section that allows us to <b style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}}>Only allow certain domains to use our app!</b></div>

### How do we do this?
<br/>
<div style={{paddingLeft: '15px'}}>
 1.  First,  visit and login through **[https://console.developers.google.com/apis ](https://console.developers.google.com/apis )**
 2.  Up at the top, select your firebase project from the dropdown element
 </div>
<div style={{width: '100%', display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', padding: '20px'}}>
    <img src="/firebase-api-domain-1.png" alt="Firebase Domain Security step 2" style={{width: '500px', maxWidth: '100%'}}/>
</div>
<div style={{paddingLeft: '15px'}}>
 3.  Then, on the sidebar to the left, click on the Credentials Tab
</div>
<div style={{width: '100%', display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', padding: '20px'}}>
    <img src="/firebase-api-domain-2.png" alt="Firebase Domain Security step 3" style={{width: '300px', maxWidth: '70%'}}/>
</div>
<div style={{paddingLeft: '15px'}}>
 4.  Now you should be able to see "Browser Key" which denotes the API key created by Firebase for your webapp
</div>
<div style={{width: '100%', display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', padding: '20px'}}>
    <img src="/firebase-api-domain-3.png" alt="Firebase Domain Security step 4" style={{width: '600px', maxWidth: '100%'}}/>
</div>
<div style={{paddingLeft: '15px'}}>
 5.  Finally, on that same 'Appplication restrictions' tab, you'll be able to select what restrictions you want to effect regarding where your API key can be used. For instance, you could limit the domain to that of your production server by clicking on <Utils>HTTP referrers</Utils> and adding your website domain to the list of websites to accept requests from.
</div>
<div style={{width: '100%', display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', padding: '20px'}}>
    <img src="/firebase-api-domain-4.png" alt="Firebase Domain Security step 5" style={{width: '500px', maxWidth: '100%'}}/>
</div>

<br/>

And after that you're pretty much set! If you're planning on developing using `Localhost` as well, you might be better off creating a clone of the 'production' firebase project with an unrestricted API key. I'm not completely sure about this, but you also may be able to get away with some IP shenanigans if you restrict by IP Address as well. That's pretty much it. See ya ðŸ‘‹.
