**Hello friends 👁️👅👁️**

This is the second version of my portfolio and blog. I try to update it every now and then with cool content/life updates. The code is a bit of a mess but feel free to clone this project and use it for anything you'd like!

### Running locally
This is a Next.JS project, so just fill out all the necessary environment variables, `npm i`, and `npm run dev` to run it locally.
